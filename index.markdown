##A man without a country

This is a personal blog about functional programming, information security, operating systems,
literature and other (less interesting) topics.

It is partitioned into three disjoint blocks, each with its own RSS feed —

 + “[Life](/life.html)”, where I write about life and non-technical stuff. À la social network feed.
 + “[Universe](/universe.html)”, posts about computer programming and technical literature go here.
 + “[In Russian](/ru.html)”, random posts in my native language. À la micro-blogging feed, plus 
   staging technical posts.

If for some reason you want to read everything, there's a feed called “[Everything](/archive.html)” 
just for that.

There are no commentaries in this blog. If you want to share your thoughts about a post here, 
you can reach me by E-mail (jmפmemorici·de) and on IRC (MagBo @ {freenode, ~~hyperboria~~, dorknet}).
All the valuable inputs will get to the virtual pages of this blog in form of posts or guest posts.

This blog ~~is hosted on a server running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/);~~
is hosted on a server running [NixOS](http://nixos.org);
generated by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) which, in turn, was 
built from [Nix expression](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/libraries/haskell/hakyll/default.nix).  
Let's all appreciate open source community!
