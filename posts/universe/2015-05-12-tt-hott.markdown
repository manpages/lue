Boys, girls, humans.

Recently I've devoured a Soviet book in Category theory and [want something more](https://medium.com/@podmostom/fear-and-loathing-b02ce21074a5).

That being said, I'm glad to announce that I'm starting a HoTT study
group in Zagreb. Going from functional programming to type theory
to topology and all the way back sounds like an awesome trip.

I'll coordinate with functional programming user group (did you know we have
one in Zg?) [Here is a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OupcXmLER7I) 
that may motivate such a study group.

We will, of course, eventually dig through
“Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics”.

Before that we want to organize the first meeting to get acquainted with each other and see how 
do we want to approach this SG.

May the types be with us. [To get included into a mail thread, contact me](http://memorici.de/me.html).
