### [tedu. 2015. Heartbleed in Rust](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/heartbleed-in-rust)

Even though I do think that this post is pretty pointless, I found it entertaining.
Besides, I do agree with tedu when he says

Silver-bullet cultists, static-typing fundamentalists and functional
programming purists shouldn't be taken seriously because fundamentalism in any
shape and form blinds its adept and makes her detached from reality.

That being said, I find the post pointless because, after stripping fundamentalist
bullshit, we're left with a statement like “while writing idiomatic parsers in
functional style we severely reduce the probability of having leaky buffers”. 
Ugly optimizations, however, oftentimes break the idiomaticness of the code, hence
the whole discussion retards to a simple pair of non-contradicting statements not
worth the holy war.
