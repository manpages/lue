### [tedu. 2015. Heartbleed in Rust](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/heartbleed-in-rust)

Even though I do think that this post is pretty pointless, I found it entertaining.
Besides, I do agree with tedu when he says

Silver-bullet cultists, static-typing fundamentalists and functional
programming purists shouldn't be taken seriously because fundamentalism in any
shape and form blinds its adept and makes her detached from reality.

That being said, I find the post pointless because, after stripping fundamentalist
bullshit, we're left with a statement like “while writing idiomatic parsers in
functional style we severely reduce the probability of having leaky buffers”. 
Ugly optimizations, however, oftentimes break the idiomaticness of the code, hence
the whole discussion retards to a simple pair of non-contradicting statements not
worth the holy war.

### Leeming C. 2014/15. On Docker
#### [Let's review.. Docker (again)](http://iops.io/blog/docker-hype/)
#### [LXC containers are awesome, but Docker.io sucks](http://iops.io/blog/lxc-application-containers-docker-initial-thoughts/)

Docker is the most famous LXC/AUFS wrapper. I didn't care enough to dig it
even though we were using it in production with one of the companies I was
working for.

In the linked posts is pretty reasonable critique of this library. Looks like my gut feeling about
projects in Go is yet to fail me.

### [Dolstra E., Visser E. 2008. The Nix Build Farm: A Declarative Approach to Continuous Integration.](http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/buildfarm-wasdett2008-final.pdf)
A [later, more complete version](http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/hydra-scp-submitted.pdf) of this
paper is available as well.  
This paper describes Hydra, the current CI system used to test Nix expressions.
A perfect thing to read before you make your first Hydra deployment.

### [Gonzalez G. 2015. Use Haskell for shell scripting](http://www.haskellforall.com/2015/01/use-haskell-for-shell-scripting.html)

Interesting project, use case of which is limited to one thing — simple shell-scripting
for teams of Haskell programmers/dev-ops. I really hope that someone will either write a
translator from Turtle to Shell, or nobody will going to ever use this library for writing
user-facing scripts.
