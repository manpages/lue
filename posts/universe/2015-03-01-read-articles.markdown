### [bennofs. 2015. Merge nix-shell and build environments of haskell derivations](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/6307) <a href="#declinedHaskellPR" name="declinedHaskellPR">¶</a>

Interesting read (both code-wise and discussion-wise). Even declined PRs are worth reading.

### [Livescience. 2015. Beyond Higgs: 5 Elusive Particles That May Lurk in the Universe](http://www.livescience.com/28126-other-particles-beyond-higgs.html) <a href="#notHiggs" name="notHiggs">¶</a>

Pop-sci journal that actually feels like it's written by paparazzi in a very distinctive scandalous language.
Enjoyed this particular article, maybe there's more, but I feel like it gets tiresome very fast.

### [Loria K. 2015. What is blue and how do we see color?](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2) <a href="#blue" name="blue">¶</a>

Another article touching the fact that human conventions and perception are arbitrary.

### [Arapov A. 2015. USB bootable NixOS - UEFI version](http://nixaid.com/usb-bootable-nixos-uefi/) <a href="#uefi">¶</a>

This article is great because if you read between the lines, you actually get to understand the mechanism UEFI uses to boot.

I'm not saying that UEFI is a good idea, I'm saying that this article plus some thinking provides one with a generic way to make UEFI-bootable iso`s.
