So I came up with a new reality show — go to an unknown city and try to find an
album of a progressive rock band. That sounds less stupid than you might think
it is, it's a great way to meet fellow progheads and see the town from the
inside. Having a goal while traveling actually makes it fun and less pointles
for me.

For me, the town was Tallinn, and the album was In the Land of Grey and Pink by
Caravan. First I went to the most hipster place I could find. It's called
[bitt.me](http://biit.me/), located on the third floor, on Pikk 9, in the Old
Town. Not only didn't they have any progressive music, but also they had little
other music than some Estonian underground. A fun shop to attend, but I had to
move on. From the guy working there I got recommendations to go to Viru Trading
centre and try Laserit (or what was it called? I don't remember, really, it was
— spoiler alert — a waste of time anyway), which was supposed to be the biggest
records shop in Tallinn.

So I went to Laserit. It had nothing. It was small. They had no idea about any
non-mainstream music. It was just sad. They sent me, however, to a hipster book
/ recording store on the third floor, which yielded no luck. In desperation, I
started to ask around for alternatives, and people suggested a new store called
"Terminal", which was in another building of the same centre. I got there to
get lost in ridiculously laid out clothes shops, but to be saved by a nice
worker of a rather shitty shop. She directed me to "Terminal".

There was no needed album there, the last copies of both LP and disk were sold
two days ago, but a guy working there actually knew a lot about Cravan, and he
knew quite a bit about the prog scene in general. He gave me three directions —
to [nailboard](https://www.nailboard.org/), which is a big webshop, rockroad
community on Facebook (these guys apparently are keen on selling musical
curiosities) and music second-hand Led Zeppelin.

I found nailboard's phone number on their website and called them, they
happened to have the album, LP and CD, original mastering and remake. I ordered
the original disk and went there to get it. NB! As it is a web-shop, their
office and their storage are at different places. Storage is on Madara 31. Go
there. There are no signs, but the employee in charge will meet you.

The disk was comparitively cheap, and the guy who sold it to me got a
considerable tip for awesomenes.

And that's how you buy progressive music in Tallinn.
