Once the student is familiar enough with the core concepts of the game, thanks
to the full information “Rochester Booster Wars” format, we can move on to play a
small, limited information format.

## <a href="#trickOrTreat" name="trickOrTreat">Trick or Treat</a>

Each player provides a booster pack and gets the set of "trick or treat" lands.
If it is a 14-card booster, this set is the following:

```
6 Mountain (Keep)
5 Plains   (Swap)
2 Forest   (Swap!)
1 Swamp    (Keep!)
1 Island   (Peek)
```

If 15-card booster packs are used, one Plains (Swap) card is added.

Players open booster packs, but don't go through the cards, instead, they set aside
the first card face down (reading it) and may read the next card in the pack (but not
the one after it).

Once that is done, players select a "trick or treat" land from their pool and put it
on the table face down. After both players put their lands face down, the lands are
turned face up and then the following happens:

If both lands are Plains (Swap), players swap the face down cards. If one of those 
is Plains and the other is Mountain (Keep), players don't swap the cards, as at least
one wants to keep the card.

However, if a player *really* wants to swap a card, he or she may use Forest (Swap!),
which can only be trumped by a Swamp (Keep!).

If a player used an Island (Peek) card, he or she gets to see opponent's "trick or treat" land
and gets to then choose a land he or she wants to replace Island with, knowing opponent's
decision. If both lands are Islands, both players have to repeat choosing a land
and putting it on the table face down.

"Deck building" is the same as in Rochester Booster Wars — you may replace up to one
card of the ones you've drafted with an Utopia card (rainbow land) and add any number
of basic land cards plus at most one additional Utopia card. Minimum deck size for
14-card booster packs is 25, for 15-card packs — 27.

Games are played with Land Elimination rule *(all land cards have “Exile this card from
your hand: search your library for a card with the same name and exile it, then shuffle
your library. You may play it this turn. This ability can't be countered.”)*.
