I'm a believer.

If I am to label my religious system, that'd be reformist Judaism.
Which is ironic, as I value Judaic Tradition very much and think of
it as of the most important part of Judaism.

That being said, I have a strong opinion on uselessness of religious
debates.

It is quite obvious that existence of G-d is unprovable in terms of 
physical world. It means that discussions involving G-d, its existence
and its miracles are orthogonal to discussions involving *observable*
reality. Simply speaking — G-d is irrelevant in trans-personal reality.

What happens when we mix discussions regarding G-d into discussions about
reality and use those to perform social decision-making? Well, even our
intentions are good, after some time we will end up with two parasitic camps of
extremists — manipulators (read: Church, corrupt pseudo-Rabbis, Muslim
terrorist cells, Induism esoteric sects, ...) and opposition (read: aggressive
atheists who make money on eternal struggle against creationists). Both
extremist groups are are at the very least non-constructive and at most —
destructive, sometimes even oppressive.

By not discussing any intelligent creation belief system publicly (doesn't
matter, yours or others') and explaining your [religious] peers why they
shouldn't do so either, you'll make the world a better, more peaceful and
G-dly place.
