Very interesting format, wonder how to put concept of mana there to play, say, X-spells.

Not sure why the requirement for cards being common or uncommon is placed there. Also, I feel like land elimination is a more subtle and cute mechanics that solves similar problem in less direct way.

Love the changeling-card though, I think that this format should be tested with limited as well. Not sure how to adjust it though.
