What a nice trip to Estonia it was...

It really got me.

I'm definitely going to live in Tallinn for at least three
months either in 2016 Autumn or 2017 Summer.  Listening to the anthem of the
trip over, and over, and over again:

Right now I'm going to Croatia (arrive on May 22nd, depart — May
25th) through Austria (arrive on May 21st) now to see my man Reslav Hollós and
some of the great friends I have there — Domagoj and Saša, Rena, of course.
After a couple of days in Zagreb, I'm going to Trieste (arrive on May 25th,
depart in the night on May 26th) to take a long ferry ride to Igoumenitsa.

From Igoumenitsa it is trivial to get to my final destination — the island of
Corfu, where Bitcoin summer school is held.

Bitcoin summer school is, basically, a cryptographic conference with an
emphasis on blockchain technologies. A word has been out that SPECTRE, a
successor to GHOST[1][2] will be announced there, so it has a potential to be a
real breakthrough in the theory of blockchain building.

On Jun 3rd, joint Serokell / IOHK team will hold a presentation on our
proceedings with RSCoin and Scorex projects, I think it's going to be something
like a three-hour panel and I'm really looking forward to meeting some of the
scientists who are interested in our ambitious experiments.

Afterwards, I'm going back to Rīga, Latvia (arrive on Jun 9th) through
Igoumenitsa, Venice, Trieste, Zagreb (only one full day there instead of a week
I planned before!), Vienna, Krakow.

On Jun 23rd I go to St.Petersburg with Kirils Skrabe to play some music at the
Engineering Castle stairs and, of course, meet my esteemed colleagues from
ITMO. On Jun 30th, I'm back to Rīga and possibly will go to Tallinn again to
have a cup of tea... Or three.
