title: Religions are Monolith

In this really short post I want to deliver one simple thought — there
is no sense to split each religion into "good sects" and "bad sects".

One can say that Judaism is alright, it's just
[casual rock-throwing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Israeli_stone_throwing)
is a tiny little bad part of it. No, it's not. It's a problem
to be dealt with. It's a problem
that discredits religion by showing that immature behaviour is casually
employed.

One can say that Christianity is alright, it's just oppressive sects,
such as LDS or Jehovah's Witnesses are a bad part. It is wrong. Those
sects exploit the philosophy of love, giving promises of care to people
who need someone to care about them, getting in return what's left of
lives of those people. This is the problem of the entire movement and it
has to be addressed by Christians.

One can say that Islam is alright, Muslims who kill other Muslims and
innocent people are the bad part. [Notice how this discourse is
exploited](http://ria.ru/religion/20140829/1021948338.html) by those who
possess power. “Hey, look, we have Sufism that's a good part”! Well,
[tell that](http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/04/killed/)
[to those Muslims](http://forum.bakililar.az/index.php?showtopic=90396)
[who kill Sufis](http://www.sedmitza.ru/text/2023327.html)
in organized and ruthless fashion. The ones who has to strive
to break this status quo first have to be people of power in Muslim-majority
governments. But they don't seem to care much, leaving religious leaders
to stand in and come up with excuses trying to convince people that Islam
is a religion of peace, it's just something “those bad guys” didn't understand.

If you are an adept of any religion, just stop for a second and think
critically about it. Stop separating your religion into movements for one
little second and see if it makes sense to fight for something like that, seen
as a monolith. See if it's worth making somebody else consider adopting your
belief system. If you think that the answer is “yes”, you are not right; even
if your “religion” is atheism.
